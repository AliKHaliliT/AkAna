          I developed this app as part of my master's thesis, primarily focusing on serving as a user interface for a lameness detection system I created. My aim was to design it to be expandable, allowing others to integrate additional systems and enhance its capabilities. Essentially, I laid the groundwork for an agricultural farmer companion app. Please note, this is merely a demo and the functionalities are not linked yet; it solely serves as a UI. As for the name, I chose "AkAna," which in my mother tongue translates to "The White Mother." AkAna represents the primordial creator-goddess in Turkic culture, revered as the goddess of water and the elder sister of Earth.
