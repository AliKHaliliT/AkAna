    "Lameness Detection": "This system uses Video Action Recognition to classify Healthy Cattle and Lame Cattle. In order to use this system, you must first record a video of the cattle walking. Then, you can upload the video to the system and it will classify the cattle as either Healthy or Lame. There are two options which you can choose to process the video. You can either process it on your own device or you can send it to the inference server for processing. The inference server is a more powerful machine and will be able to process the video faster. However, it will take longer to send the video to the server and receive the results. The inference server is also not always available. If you choose to process the video on your own device, it will take longer to process the video but you will receive the results faster."
